My program can be compiled using a Java compiler. 
First you will need to unzip the folder where this is found. 
After you unzip the program, Open your Java Compiler. Here click, new java project and unclick "Use default location". After that, browse for the unzipped folder and click finish. Open all the classes in your compiler. To run it you will need to choose, run as java application. 

When you execute the program a simple menu will appear. You will have four choices (1,2,3,4). You have four tries. If you enter three numbers or anything not equal to 1,2,3, or 4, the program will terminate. 

Number Menu
From the main menu, if you enter 1 you will enter the Numbers Menu. Their again you will have the choice of three diferent options (1,2,3). You only have three choices. If you enter three numbers or anything not equal to 1,2, or 3, you will be sent back to main menu.
Case 1:
If you enter 1 you will process the quadratic equation. You are asked to enter three numbers. The A,B, and C in the quadratic formula. Choose a number. Hit enter. Choose another number and hit enter. Choose the third number and hit enter again. It will process the quadratic equation with the three numbers you entered. It will give you the solutions. If no real solution it will return "null". It will also give the number of real Solutions. After it finishes it returns automatically back to the Numbers Menu.
Case2: 
If you enter 2 you will process the average of numbers. You are told to enter as many numbers as you want and when you finish enter a negative number. This negative number won't be included with all the other numbers. It is just and indicator of when you are done. This will give you the average of all the numbers you entered. After computing this, it will return to the Numbers Menu automatically. 
Case3: 
If you enter 3 you will Exit the number menu and go back to the Main Menu. 

String Menu
From the Main menu if you enter 1, you will enter the String Menu. Here you are presented with three option (1,2,3). You have three tries, If you enter three numbers or anything not equal to 1,2, or 3. The program will return to the main menu. 
Case 1: 
If you enter 1, you will enter the Reverse a string method. You are asked to enter a string to be formated. You will enter any type of string. When you finish hit enter and it will print out the string in reverse. It will automatically then return to the string menu. 
Case2: 
If you enter 2, you will enter the format a string method. You are asked to enter a string and then, enter a format in "x" or "-". You will enter your string and your format. The program will return, the X will be replaced with your character and the dashes will separate your string. After the program returns your string formatted, it will ask if you want to enter another format to represent your same string. If you wish to do this enter "yes". If you don't wish to do this enter anything else other than yes. It will send you to the String Menu. Here you may enter again and if you wish enter another String to be formated.
